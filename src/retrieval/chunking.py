    Document chunker using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with configurable
    chunk size and overlap.

    Planned enhancement: when an embedding_model is provided, use cosine
    similarity between sentence embeddings to find natural semantic boundaries
    before splitting. For now, the recursive strategy is production-safe and
    well-tested.

    Rename history: was SemanticChunker — renamed SmartChunker to avoid
    implying semantic boundaries are computed (they are not yet).
